## Installation

You can install the development version of dipsim from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcgov/dipsim")
```

## Example

This is a basic example of using `dipsim` to simulate a data set of 50
rows, based on data transformed into parquet format. The data set
`penguins` is found in the CRAN package, `palmerpenguins`.

``` r
library(dipsim)
dataset_size = 1000 
wd <- "/Users/brobert/Desktop"
```

``` r
##-------------------------- load routine -------------------------------
parquet_fp <- search_parquet_data()

create_folder_structure(folder_location = wd, name = basename(parquet_fp))

data <- generate_theoretical(support = parquet_fp, resize = 100000, folder_location = wd)

generate_empirical(samp_size = 50, folder_location = wd, name = basename(parquet_fp))
```

``` r
##-------------------------- generate test data -------------------------
##------ generate test data step
generate_testdata(folder_location = wd, name = basename(parquet_fp), dataset_size = dataset_size)

simulated_data <- read_testdata(folder_location = wd, name = basename(parquet_fp))
```

``` r
##--------------------------- diagnostics --------------------------------
##----- diagnostics step + helper function
original_data <- readr::read_csv(glue("{wd}/{basename(parquet_fp)}/
                                      distributions/theoretical/theoretical.csv"),
                                 na = character())

cols <- compare_data(original_data, simulated_data)

vis_sim (original_data, simulated_data, cols) 
```
