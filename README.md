## What is dipsim?

It is an R package with tools designed for simulating data from data
sets in `.parquet` format. It was primarily developed to help BCGov
researchers working in the DIP to create secondary datasets for use
during testing and development.

Developing code for data science applications can be time consuming and
testing code on massive data sets can slow down development
significantly. `dipsim` helps by providing a way to quickly create
smaller versions of the actual data set.

## Getting Help

To report bugs/issues/feature requests, please file an
[issue](https://github.com/bcgov/dipsim/issues).


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [R](https://www.r-project.org) `R --version` \> 4.0
-   [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio-server/)
    `RStudio --version` \> 2022.07.0(Spotted Wakerobin)

### Installation Documentation

You can install the development version of dipsim from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcgov/dipsim")
```

### Example Workflow

This is a basic example of using `dipsim` to simulate a data set of 50
rows, based on data transformed into parquet format. The data set
`penguins` is found in the CRAN package, `palmerpenguins`.

``` r
library(dipsim)
dataset_size = 1000 
wd <- "/Users/brobert/Desktop"
```

``` r
##-------------------------- load routine -------------------------------
parquet_fp <- search_parquet_data()

input_data <- make_input_data(support_fp = parquet_fp, resize = 100000, folder_location = wd)

```

``` r
##-------------------------- generate simulated data -------------------------
simulated_data <- make_simulated_data (samp_size = 50, folder_location = wd, 
                     name = tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(parquet_fp)),
                     dataset_size = 100)
```

``` r
##--------------------------- diagnostics --------------------------------
##----- diagnostics step + helper function
original_data <- glue::glue("{wd}/{tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(parquet_fp))}/distributions/theoretical/theoretical.csv")
original_data <- readr::read_csv(original_data, na = character())

cols <- compare_data(original_data, simulated_data)

vis_sim (original_data, simulated_data, cols) 
```

``` r
##----------------------- clean up temp folder
f=glue::glue("{wd}/{tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(parquet_fp))}")
unlink(f, recursive = TRUE)
```

## Documentation

After installing the package you can view vignettes by typing
`browseVignettes("dipsim")` in your R session.
